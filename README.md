Hi, I'm m-doescode.

I play video games obviously and have a passion for coding.

I prefer to use Python, Java, PHP, or C++ whichever one is best for the scenario.

I do:
* Minecraft modding in Forge
* Win32 apps and libraries
* Java libraries
* Frontend development

And I contribute every once in a while if I find something patchworthy.
